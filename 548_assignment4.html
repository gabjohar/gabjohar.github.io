                <p>For this assignement, we had to make a piece of furniture and I decided to make a bedside table for the incredibly narrow space between my side of the bed and the wall.

                  <p>Once I figured out the measurements, I drew my parts in Rhino using only the top view. I decided to go with press fit joints and made holes in the side panels that were the same width as my plywood board's thickness (~ 0.39 ").</p>

                <p>Thanks to Nadya's excellent shopbot demo on Monday and Danli's and Blair's support, setting up the shopbot and transferring the files from Rhino to VCarve went like a breeze. Or maybe a strong wind. We made sure tabs were added (not too thick, not too many) and dog bones at each corner of each joint (thanks for the reminder Danli!). <p>

                  <p>I retraced my steps and ended up starting over completely, thinking that maybe the ways the shapes were lined up mattered but the simulation still wasn't behaving the way I expected.</p>
