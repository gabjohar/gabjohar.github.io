                <p>For this assignement, we had to make a piece of furniture and I decided to make a bedside table for the incredibly narrow space between my side of the bed and the wall.

                  <p>Once I figured out the measurements, I drew my parts in Rhino using the top view. I decided to go with press fit joints and made holes in the side panels that were the same width as the thickness of my plywood board (0.39 ").</p>

                <p>Thanks to Nadya's excellent shopbot demo on Monday and Danli's and Blair's support, setting up the shopbot and transferring the files from Rhino to VCarve went fairly well. We did break an end mill but how else do you learn ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. <br> We made sure to add tabs (not too thick, not too many) and dog bones at each corner of each joint. <p>

                  <p>Pieces milled! Some post-processing took place in the form of cutting tabs and sanding the pieces to get rid of the little wooly texture left by the upper cut end mill.</p>
