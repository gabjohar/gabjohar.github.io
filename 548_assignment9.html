              <h2>Inspiration and concept</h2>

                <p>The final project was about systems integration and we had to make something that used most, if not all, the techniques learned in class this quarter. My original idea was to create a light remniscent of Rothko's paintings, and more specifically of the Rothko Chapel, which uses light to create a certain sense of the numinous when viewing the paintings. I've always thought it would be cool if sensors were integrated in this exhibit, where the closer you got to the painting, the brighter the light would get.</p>

                <p>Originally I thought of making a resin sheet with lights cast-in-place to create this effect but chose to have little cubic lights instead that I could place all over my apartment. They would light up slowly as I approached and fade as I walked away. My choice of sensor, however, made that interaction difficult: I chose a motion sensor (PIR), which is on/off, and not a distance sensor, which would have enabled me to map the distance values to the brightness of the led.</p>

                 <p><strong>Techniques used for this project:</strong> <br>
                    1. 3D modeling <br>
                    2. Circuit design <br>
                    3. PCB making (milling + surface mount soldering) <br>
                    4. CNC milling <br>
                    5. 3D printing  <br>
                    5. Resin casting <br>
                    6. Programming <br>

                <h2>The circuit: vital connections</h2>

                <p> I made two boards for this project. My initial board wasn't sound and I figured that out by comparing it to the reference board. I fixed it using the Nadya-finds-trash-on-the-soldering-station technique, which I later used not as a fix but as a part of my board design.</p>

                <p>I also had trouble with the double sidedness of my first board (a CAM issue with the Othermill) which led me to create these blobs of solder to secure a good connection to GND. It was successful (the board worked) but flimsy.</p>

                <p>As you can see, some pretty vital connections were missing from V1 of the board.</p>

                <p>Once fixed, it worked great! Connections were still flimsy though, so I made a new board NOT double sided and purposefully used the NFTSS technique as a hack instead of spending 3 more hours on kicad rerouting traces.</p>

                <p>The code is pretty straighforward for this project. Here it is:</p>

                <p>Making the resin cubes was also pretty straighfoward and yielded great results! I am pretty happy with how they came out.</p>
