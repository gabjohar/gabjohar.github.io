            <h1>A6: Designing PCB - Small and big traces</h1>
            <p>
              <h2>From circuit design to programming</h2>
                <p>For this assignment we had to 1)design our own PCB, 2) surface mount solder it and 3) program it. That last step didn't work for  me but I got plenty of practice in steps 1 and 2. Here are a few stats on this assignment:</p>

                 <p> 1. Milled PCBs: 4</p>
                 <p> 2. Soldered PCBs: 3</p>
                 <p> 3. Soldering injuries: 2</p>
                 <p> 4. Soldering time: From 2h to 30 min</p>
                 <p> 5. Programmed PCBs: 0</p>

                <h2>First round</h2>

                <p> I slightly adapted Nadya's original design by adding a connector for my sensor and a resistor. One thing I forgot to do that would have made my life easier is making the traces and pads bigger. But I decided to keep them small and see what happens (spoiler: small traces break more easily, especially if you're new at SM soldering.)</p>

                <p>Once the design was validated, I got ready for milling. Based on my learnings from <a href="https://gabjohar.github.io/548_assignment5.html">A5</a>, I made sure all my offset measurements (material and plan) were correct. I milled two PCBs, anticipating potential setbacks during the soldering phase.</p>

                <p>The results.</p>

                <p>Now getting ready for soldering!</p>

                <p>Testing.</p>

                <img src="548/A6/15.jpg" width=400>

                <p>I thank Danli and Blair for helping me out with the programming part! Danli offered to help with Arduino-as-programming-board setup and Blair pointed me towards the <a href="http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695">High Low Tech resource page on how to do AVR programming with the Arduino IDE.</a> Despite being a good tutorial, it didn't work out because my circuit wasn't sound.</p>

                <p>So back to the soldering station!</p>

                  <p>I soldered my other board but it also had problems.</p>
                     <p></p>

                <p>Another "funny" thing that happened was that while I was vacuuming I accidentally vacuumed two mini boards, ending up with 4 boards instead of 6.<p>
                <p></p>

                  <p>The next part was the actual soldering. I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/f9fbqks3BS8">this tutorial</a> and it helped a lot in better understanding what needed to happen. It seems obvious when you know it, but isn't so when all you've done is big pieces soldering.</p>
                     <p></p>

                  <p>Not a great soldering job...</p>

                  <p>And it didn't work... My guess is because the solder is not just on the pad but gets onto the rest of the board?</p>
                     <p></p>


                <h2>So what did I learn?</h2>

                <p>That the Z offset is in fact the <strong>Z</strong> offset, not the XY offset. It somehow wasn't clear enough or I wasn't paying enough attention. </p>

                 <p>That even when you fail, you need to document (perhaps especially when you fail). </p>

                  <p>That sometimes fatigue and discouragement get in the way; to recognize that they do and work with that knowledge.</p>
