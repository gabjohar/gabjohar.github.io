                For this assignment, I fused two meshes of hands to produce a sculpture of facing hands.</p>

            <h2>Part II: Getting started on a lamp</h2>
            <div class = "cat">

                <p> Inspiration: crystal lamps! Pretty straightforward 3D printed lattice box allowing crystal formations.<br> Additive manufacturing meets organic structures.</p>

            <div class = "cat">
            <img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_innerds_dim.PNG" width=500><img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_sketches_1.PNG" width=500><img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_sketches_2.PNG" width=500><img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_final_dims.PNG" width=500><img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_plan_2.jpg" width=500>
            <p>I started by measuring my lamp innerds and made a few sketches of what I wanted the lamp to look like.</p>

            <div class = "cat">
            <img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/original_pattern.jpg" width=400><p>I thought an organic pattern would be nice for the lattice.<br>I cleaned it in Illustrator and fixed all the intersecting curves that would have messed up the extrusion in Rhino.</p>
            <a href=https://github.com/gabjohar/gabjohar.github.io/blob/master/A4/lamp/prototype%201/organic%20pattern_2.ai> Ai file</a>
            </p> 
            <p>
            Then I played around in Rhino: extruded my shape, used a polar array to make a box, added a base and made a whole to <br>pass my lamp innerds through using a cylinder and BooleanDifference.</p>

                <p> The lamp prototype then looked something like this as an STL...</p>

                <p>...and like this in Cura, which has some pretty dramatic undercuts...</p>
                <img src="A4/lamp/prototype%201/lamp_proto1_cura_supports.png" width=400>
                <p> ...and looked absolutely crazy with (the necessary) supports, plus was an almost 8-hour long project :/<br>
                My pattern is probably better suited for a laser cutter. I need to find a different pattern or find a<br>
                way to print the walls separately and assemble them without glue afterwards.</p>
