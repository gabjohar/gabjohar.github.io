            <h1>A8: Serial communication or the Blinking Orange Light Saga</h1>

            <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> my board had trouble connecting to the programmer and it took me 7 hours to figure it out. Complete saga below.</p>
            <p>
              <h2>Board design</h2>

                <p>We all used Nadya's board design as a starting point. I added an LED for my output. A novelty for this board was that it was double sided; we all used the other side of the board to connect the GND.</p>

                <h2>Milling and SM soldering</h2>

                <p>The one part of the assignment when I felt truly confident.</p>


                <h2>Serial communication</h2>
              <div class = "cat">
                <p>This is when the trouble began. At first, when I connected my board to the computer with the serial cable I got a green light from the programmer, which always feels good. I then set the fuses of the at44 using <strong>avrdude</strong> (thanks Blair for helping me with the install!). That worked well. I made sure the board settings in the Arduino IDE were right (board, processor, clock, programmer) and uploaded Nadya's echo sketch. I got the following error: </p> 

              <img src="548/A8/images/error 1.png" width=800> 

                <p>The first thing I did was check all my connections, especially between the programmer and the at44. Everything looked good. I plugged in the programmer in reverse and got the same message. I then went online, looked for possible causes. </p>

                <img src="548/A8/images/6. SPI bus busy.png" width=800> 

                <p>One of them was that something on the SPI bus might interfere with the communication with the chip. I felt that was unlikely, but perhaps this is explains why we need to disconnect the programmer once we've uploaded our code if we want serial to work (as Blair discovered).</p>

                <p>Another theory was that I wasn't <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/t/trouble-installing-bootloader/346640">getting good power.</a> My programmer was also blnking orange constantly at that point, which corroborated the power issue, per <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-42093-AVR-ISP-mkII_UserGuide.pdf"> Atmel's AVRISP mkII documentation.</a></p>

                <p>So maybe it was my connectors that weren't making good contact. Back to the soldering station!</p>

                <img src="548/A8/images/9. surgery.jpg" width=700>

                <p>The intervention definitely helped because when I plugged in the programmer again the light went green! Hooray! Tiny progress.</p>

                <p>And while the sketch still wouldn't upload, AVR was no longer complaining.</p>

                <p>But still, something was up with the connection. Perhaps <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15313269/avrispmkii-connection-status-unknown-status-0x00"> even the clock?.</a> I messed with that a bit using avrdude, with no success. I also added tape to my board and strenghtened a few more connections, in case that might helped with power supply.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, hours later, I found this <a href="https://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/avrdude.html"> really great AVR tutorial.</a>  I think my problem is that my board isn't properly connected to the chip.</p>

                <p>So tomorrow, I'll mill another board while I mill the one for my final project and try again with thicker traces and more clearance to make sure I have solid connections.</p>
