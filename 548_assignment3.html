                <p>My inspiration came from my drying rack and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz60Psx_Cp0&list=PL4GuYp1AV9zcBLc963Q1JACkdmtUBae0S&index=2&ab_channel=MrExpert">video on how to make an hydraulic scissor lift</a>.

                  <p>Making the scissor lift was pretty straightforward. I cut 8 strips of cardboard and connected them with paper pins and cut paper straws. Then I sowed my sensor (which changed the resistance significantly! My range went from 0-1023 to ~800-1023). I had two main issues with this assignment and the first was figuring out how to instrument my mechanism with the sensor. I ended up making a little spring out of cardboard and placing the sensor and the bottom pole of the lift. Actuating the mechanism would then result in pressure changes on the sensor.</p>

                <p>This is the part of the assignment that didn't go so well, i.e. the "second issue." I basically couldn't get my shapes to move the way I wanted, despite following Nadya's instructions on how to use Kangaroo. The <code>coincident</code> component did not make the starting points of my curves coincide, so there was no constrain. At the same time, they seemed overly constrained by the fact that I initally input the start of my six curves (3 for each shape) as part of my <code>GoalObjects</code>. I tried three different configurations of shapes and curves but it still did not work.

                  <p>I retraced my steps and ended up starting over completely, thinking that maybe the ways the shapes were lined up mattered but the simulation still wasn't behaving the way I expected.</p>
