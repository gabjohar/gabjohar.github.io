              <h2>Concept: Body poetry</h2>
                  <img src="A7/body_poetry.gif" width=300></a>
                <p>I discovered poetry when I was 17 or 18, with T.S. Eliot. The love was instant.<br> I was still learning English at the time and I was fascinated by the rhythms,<br> sounds and images the language could produce. It's been a passion of mine ever since.<br>Like maths, jazz or Rhino, poetry doesn't give itself easily but the pleasure <br> comes from the work you put into it.</p>
                <p> I've been playing with text generating RNN for the past 6 months and want<br>  to create a piece that incorporates some of that work with the tactility and <br>physicality of a 3D printed piece. The idea is to create a wearable that features<br>a light ML system running on a tiny MCU equipped with accelerometers. I would <br> train it to recognize certain gestures and map them to specific voice outputs. That <br> way that you could compose poems by moving.</p>
                <p> For the final project, I will focus mostly on the shell.</p>
                <p></p>

                  <p>There are a few boards out there that would fit the bill. The Sparkfun Edge Board is one. Arduino also makes one,<br> and so does Adafruit, which is the one I have (see above).</p>

                <p>My plan is to design a bracelet in Rhino and print it. It'll have to be sturdy enough for dancing without breaking or falling and also accomodate the board's ports, lights and LCD screen.</p>


                <p>
              <h2>Plan</h2>
              <p>1. Take my board measurements.</p>
              <p>2. Design my bracelet in Rhino.</p>
              <p>3. Export STL, slice and print.</p>
              <p>4. Test and adjust.</p>
