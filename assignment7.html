              <h2>Concept: Body poetry</h2>
                  <img src="A7/body_poetry.gif" width=400></a>
                <p>I discovered poetry when I was 17 or 18, with T.S. Eliot. The love was instant.<br> I was still learning English at the time and I was fascinated by the rhythms,<br> sounds and images the language could produce. It's been a passion of mine ever since.<br>Like maths, jazz or Rhino, poetry doesn't give itself easily but the pleasure <br> comes from the work you put into it.</p>
                <p> I've been playing with text generating RNN for the past 6 months and want<br>  to create a piece that incorporates some of that work with the tactility and <br>physicality of a 3D printed piece. The idea is to create a wearable that features<br>a light ML system running on a tiny MCU equipped with accelerometers. I would <br> train it to recognize certain gestures and map them to specific voice outputs. That <br> way that you could compose poems by moving.</p>
                <p> For the final project, I will focus mostly on the shell.</p>

                  <p>There are a few boards out there that fit the bill. The Sparkfun Edge Board is one. Arduino also makes one,<br> and so does Adafruit, which is the one I have (see above).</p>

                <p>My plan is to design a bracelet in Rhino and print it. It'll have to be sturdy enough for dancing without breaking or falling and also accomodate the board's ports, lights and LCD screen.</p>


                <p>
              <h2>Plan</h2>
              <p>1. Take my board measurements --> May 22 </p>
              <p>2. Design my bracelet in Rhino --> May 23-25</p>
              <p>3. Export STL, slice and print --> May 25</p>
              <p>4. Test and adjust --> May 26</p>

              <h2>Production: making a case</h2>
              <img src="A7/A7_photos/1.all_8_versions.jpg" width=600></a>
                <p> This project was mostly about trying to make a case for my board. That was<br>difficult! But even though it's probably my least successful project in this class,<br>it's been one of the most informatives because it required understanding the<br> mechanics of case-making instead of focusing on technique. I made many different<br>versions and each one thought me something. I eventually pivoted to making a mold,<br>which I'm in the process of building.</p>
                 <p></p>

                 <div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/2.v1_2.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/3.v1.jpg" width=400>
                  <p><strong>V1</strong> was fairly rudimentary: 2 discs with clips to hold them together, with the board sandwiched between them. Needless to say: not sturdy. </p>
   
   				<div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/6.v2_or_v3.jpg" width=400>

          <div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/4.v2.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/5.v2_3.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/7.v3.jpg" width=400>
                  <p>For <strong>V2 and V3</strong> I went for a different form factor, following<br> the example of a case I saw on Adafruit's website. But the lid didn't fit and<br> the board was too loose in the case. I tried to address these issues in V3 by<br> resizing and adding little stabilizing rods inside the case. But the top still<br> didn't fit. </p>

                <div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/8.v3_alt_2.jpg" width=400>
                  <p>I printed a <strong>V3 ALT</strong> by tweaking Adafruit's case. It taught me<br>that a round form factor would work better and that the lid would securely fit<br> to the case with little snaps. </p>

                   <img src="A7/A7_photos/11.v4_4.jpg" width=400>

              <div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/12.v5_sketch.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/9.v4_2.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/10.v4.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/gizmo_v6.png" width=450><img src="A7/A7_photos/gizmo_v5.png" width=450>
                  <p><strong>V4, V5, V6, V7 and V8</strong> were all variations of the same idea: <br>adding little snaps to the lid and to the case so that they would securely fit<br> together. My calculations were always a few milimeters off however, and even<br> though the board was snug in its case, I didn't manage to print a lid that fit.<br> The fact that my 3D printer's bed wasn't leveled didn't help, despite my efforts<br>to level it.

                  <p>Looking for inspiration on the internets, I saw the Adafruit's wearable case <br>and thought that silicon might be the way. So now, on to mold making!</p>

                <div class = "cat">

                  <p>I sketched my mold and designed it in Rhino and then printed it. I mized way<br> too much OOMOO so I improvised molds with extra plastic cups and some of the<br>previous cases I had printed.</p>

                <div class = "cat">
                  <img src="A7/A7_photos/16.mold_v1.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/19.demolded_2.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/20.demolded_3.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/21.broken_mold.jpg" width=400><img src="A7/A7_photos/18.demolded.jpg" width=400>    
                  <p>The improvised molds turned out to be the most successful! The walls of the<br> main cast were too thin and ripped when I tried to extract the case out of the<br> mold (last picture). The other molds were okay-ish but not exactly what I<br>need for my project.</p>
