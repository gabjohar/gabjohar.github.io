              <h2>Concept: Body poetry</h2>
                  <img src="A7/body_poetry.gif" width=300></a>
                <p>In my other life I was a literature student and I discovered poetry when I was<br>17 or 18, with T.S. Eliot. The love was instant. I was still learning English at the<br>time and was mesmerized by the rhythms, the sounds and the images this <br>language could produced.</p>
                <p> I've been playing with text generating neural nets for the past 6 months or so<br> and want to create a piece that incorporates some of that work with the tactility <br> and physicality of a 3D printed piece. The idea is to create a wearable <br> that features a small ML system running on a tiny CMU equipped with accelerometers <br> that would map gestures to words, so that you could compose poems <br> by moving.

                  <p>There are a bunch of boards out there that fit the bill. The Sparkfun Edge<br>Board is one (on the left). Arduino also makes one, and so does Ada fruit, which is the one I have. (right)</p>

                <p>My plan is to design a bracelet in Rhino and print it. It'll have to be sturdy<br>enough for dancing and accomodate the ports, lights en LCD screen of my Ada board.</p>


                <p>
              <h2>Plan</h2>
              <p>1. Take my board measurements.</p>
              <p>2. Design my bracelet in Rhino.</p>
              <p>3. Export STL, slice and print.</p>
              <p>4. Test and adjust.</p>
