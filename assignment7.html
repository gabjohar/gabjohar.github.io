              <h2>Concept: Body poetry</h2>
                  <img src="A7/body_poetry.gif" width=300></a>
                <p>In my other life I was a literature student who discovered poetry when she was<br>17 or 18, with T.S. Eliot. The love was instant. I was still learning English at the<br>time and I was mesmerized by the rhythms, sounds and images this language<br>could produce.</p>
                <p> I've been playing with text generating RNN for the past 6 months and wan<br>  to create a piece that incorporates some of that work with the tactility and <br>physicality of a 3D printed piece. The idea is to create a wearable that features<br>a light ML system running on a tiny MCU equipped with accelerometers. I would <br> train it to recognize certain gestures and map them to specific voice outputs. That <br> way that you could compose poems by moving.

                  <p>There are a bunch of boards out there that fit the bill. The Sparkfun Edge Board is one (top). Arduino also makes one,<br> and so does Adafruit, which is the one I have (bottom).</p>

                <p>My plan is to design a bracelet in Rhino and print it. It'll have to be sturdy enough for dancing without breaking or falling <br> and accomodate the ports, lights and the LCD screen of the board.</p>


                <p>
              <h2>Plan</h2>
              <p>1. Take my board measurements.</p>
              <p>2. Design my bracelet in Rhino.</p>
              <p>3. Export STL, slice and print.</p>
              <p>4. Test and adjust.</p>
